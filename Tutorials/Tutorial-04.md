# Tutorial 04

Plot the following and make sure to include relevant axes labels, legends and colour bars as required.

- Generate 100 equally spaced points between 0 to 100 for x and another set of random points for e. Evaluate y1 = 2x + e and y2 = 2x. Plot y1 as a blue scatter and y2 as a red line. (2 marks)
- Generate 5 sets of random numbers of size 10 and find the sum of them. Plot them as a bar plot. Make each set correspond to 'Sample 1', 'Sample 2',... ,'Sample 5'. (2 marks)
- Generate a 2D np.meshgrid with equally spaced values of (0 to 2pi) x (0 to 2pi). Evaluate a 2D function given by Z = cos(X).sin(Y). Now create a heatmap of this function. (3 marks)
- Sample 10000 data points from Normal(0,1), Uniform(-1,1), Exponential(1), Poisson(1) distributions. Plot the histograms on a 2 x 2 subplot for each. Similarly, make a box plot of these distributions to compare them. (4 marks)
