# Tutorial 03

- Implement a class for (mathematical) 2D Vector. Add methods to get magnitude and direction (unit vector) of the vector. Add methods to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and comparison. Implement `*` as dot product, `@` `(__matmul__)` as cross product and use magnitude for comparison (`__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__le__`, `__ge__`). (3 marks)
- Pass a numpy array to a function, do the values get changed in the global scope when you mutate it inside the function?
- Given a 2D numpy array (matrix), write a program to get the sum along the diagonal.
- Given a numpy array, add 10 to all element less than 5 without using for loops.
- Create a 10 x 10 numpy array with x[0,0]=1 and x[-1,-1]=100 and the other elements are equally spaced from each other (without using for loops)
- Create a numpy array of len 2 and consider it as a mathematical vector. Perform a linear transformation that rotates it by 30 degrees. (Hint: Linear transformations can be represented as a matrix)
