- Write a Python program that takes in a string and returns a dictionary where the keys are the characters in the string and the values are the number of occurrences of each character.
- Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and finds the kth largest and kth smallest number in the list.
- Write a Python function that checks if a given word is a palindrome using recursion.

        - Mean
        - Standard Deviation
        - Median
        - Mode
